Tennis bracket predictor:

- Get the starting men's singles draw and list all the first round games.
- Have the number of games for winner and loser
- Data point is going to be a game -> points of each player
- Need to predict the points each player will get in a game
- Correlation between the game play of each player: player's score depends on the other player
- Each player has an offense and defense vector that we want to predict
- Once we have the vector, we can compute the number of games each player will win in the match
- Need to figure out how to factor in other features like type of court, head to head
